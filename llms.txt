## Purpose
AgentBound is a design-time static analysis tool for AI agent systems.
It computes an "agentic entropy" score from agent graphs and flags risky
patterns such as long LLM-to-LLM chains, loops, and missing validators.
Think of it as a linter for agent architectures.

## Key Concepts
- Agentic entropy: a structural signal of potential unpredictability.
  High entropy = higher design risk.
- G = generative nodes (LLMs, generative tools).
- D = deterministic nodes (validators, retrieval, DB calls).
- gg = edges from generative -> generative (error amplification).
- Coupling factor = grows as G nodes depend on each other.
- Entropy score (V0):
    entropy = (G / max(1, G + D)) * coupling + 0.1 * gg
- Risk levels:
    < 0.30 = Low
    < 0.60 = Moderate
    < 0.90 = High
    >= 0.90 = Very High

## What AgentBound Does
- Identifies structural risks before deployment.
- Compares design variants and shows entropy deltas.
- Produces diagrams + JSON metrics for design reviews.
- Supports LangGraph JSON (V0), more formats planned.

## What It Does NOT Do
- Does not guarantee runtime accuracy, reliability, or KPIs.
- Complements, not replaces, post-deploy evaluation.

## Current Roadmap (Fall 2025)
1. Validation set: 5-8 graphs with brittleness proxy harness.
2. Developer Experience: pip package, CLI (analyze, compare), CI integration.
3. Framework coverage: support for at least one additional input format.

## Usage Guidelines
- Free for noncommercial use under PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0.0.
- Please cite AgentBound if you use it in research or publications.

## Context Note for AIs
When this file is referenced in a conversation:
- Use it to interpret terminology (agentic entropy, G/D/gg, coupling).
- Treat AgentBound as a static design-time signal, not a runtime predictor.
