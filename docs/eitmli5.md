### 🧠 What is AgentBound?

AgentBound is a tool that helps people **understand how unpredictable their AI system might be — before they run it**.

If you're building something with AI — especially with multiple parts like:
- A planner
- A generator
- A validator
- A memory retriever...

...then your system is like a group of mini-thinkers (called "agents") working together.

But here’s the problem:  
> If too many of those mini-thinkers are creative and unpredictable, your whole system can start to go off track.

AgentBound helps you **spot that risk early**, and make your system more stable, safe, and understandable.

### 🎯 Why should anyone care?

- Because AI systems aren’t just one model anymore — they’re **combinations** of many parts.
- And just like a team, if everyone does their own thing with no structure, things break.
- AgentBound shows you where that might happen **before anything goes wrong.**

---

### 🧯 What kinds of things can go wrong?

- The system writes something totally off-topic
- It loops forever trying to “rethink” a plan
- It gives answers that sound smart but drift away from the original goal
- It changes behavior in small ways you don’t catch until it’s too late

AgentBound can help catch these patterns early — **not by judging the content**, but by measuring how risky the system’s structure is.

### 🧩 What does it actually do?

It:
- Looks at how your system is set up
- Estimates which parts are “creative” vs “strict”
- Measures how much unpredictability might flow through the system
- Warns you about parts that are *too open-ended* or *too risky*

---

### ✅ What kind of people might use this?

- Engineers designing multi-step AI workflows
- Researchers building tool-using agents
- Companies who want to make sure their AI stays on track
- Anyone who cares about **AI that’s creative, but still controllable**

### 🌟 One-sentence summary

> AgentBound helps you find the places where your AI system might wander off — *before* it does.
